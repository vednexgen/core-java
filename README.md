# Welcome to the **Java Programming Course**! ðŸŽ‰

#### This course is designed to take you from the basics of Java programming to advanced concepts, step by step.
#### Whether you are a beginner or have prior programming experience, this course will help you gain strong foundations and practical skills in Java.

This repository contains code examples for understanding various **Java concepts**.  
Each concept is organized into its own **package** for better clarity and separation.

- ðŸ“¦ Each **package** represents a specific Java concept (e.g., `variables`, `loops`, `collections`, etc.).
- ðŸ“„ A **README.md** file is included inside every package to provide:
    - A description of the concept.
    - The list of files/classes included with sample code.
    - Usage notes or examples (if applicable).

This structure helps learners easily navigate through different topics and quickly find the related code examples.
